# Smart Sprinkler System
##   A Senior Design Project by:
###    Bryce Martin & David Carlson
  
The Basics:  
 \- Main.py : Point of entry for program to start running from.  
 \- JSONSrv.py : Houses the code that runs a basic.http python server to answer RESTful requests.  
 \- Edith.py : Contains the code that essentially functions as a typical sprinkler timer/control box.  
 \- HAL.py : Interfaces with the Xbee Coordinator module, then stores data.  
 \- Jarvis.py : Is the *Global Variables* of the program.  
 \- Xbee/main.py : Code that is loaded onto the Nodes/Routers  
 \- XbeeSrv/main.py : What runs on the Coordinator  
  
  
Android app Development is also taking place -- On a separate branch  
  
  
  
Eventually we will get an appropriate license typed out in here, but suffice it to say...  
This is Open Source, and a current work in progress.
