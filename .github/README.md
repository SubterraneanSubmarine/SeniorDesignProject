# Smart Sprinkler System
## A Senior Design Project by:
### Bryce Martin & David Carlson

The Basics:
 \- Main.py : Point of entry for program to start running from.
 \- JSONSrv.py : Houses the code that runs a basic.http python server to answer RESTful access.
 \- Edith.py : Contains the code that essentially functions as a typical sprinkler timer/control box.
 \- HAL.py : Interfaces with the Xbee Coordinator module, then stores data.
 \- Jarvis.py : Is the *Global Variables* of the program.




Eventually we will get an appropriate license typed out in here, but sufficit to say...
This is Open Source, and a current work in progress.
